            <h1>Odd Future <br> Wolf Gang <br>Kill Them All</h1>

            <p class="intro_text"> Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All, more commonly know as Odd Future or simply OF, <b>is one of the most influential rap groups</b> of the last decade. The group, founded in 2007, consisted of over ten
                members of different
                rappers, artists, and producers. They rose quickly to popularity with their unique sound of alternative hip-hop. <br><br>Agressive, out-there, and <b>seriously not giving a f**k</b>, are all words that come to mind when reminiscing on the
                group.

                Their
                concerts were known for extreme hype, mosh-pits, and a lot of adrenaline. <br><br>The group also had a huge influnece on street-wear and even released their own Odd Future line (known as Golf Wang) which still has a place in fashion today.
                The signatue OF Donut has become an iconic logo in the streetwear industry. <br><br> The group split up a
                few years
                ago so that members could pursue their own (very sucessful) solo careers. However, all hip-hop fans will forever know the importance of Odd Future in the music world. <br><br>The most vital members of the group are discussed below!</p>

                <h2 id="Tyler" class="grid-hed">Tyler. <br>the Creator</h2>
                <img class="grid-img" src="tyler.1.png" alt="Tyler. the Creator">
                <p class="grid-text">The leader and one of the main founders of Odd Future, Tyler. the Creator, was a key part of the OF lifestyle and sound. He was also the star of the Odd Future comedy show <i>Loiter Squad</i> which aired on Comedy
                    Central for a few years. Since his Odd Future days, Tyler has released five studio albums, with his most previous one winning an Oscar. He is one of the most iconic hip-hop artist in the game today.</p>

                <img class="grid-img" src="frank.1.jpg" alt="Frank Ocean">
                <p class="grid-text">Mainly known as a mesmorizing singer (as opposed to a rapper like most of his Odd Future peers) Frank Ocean was a vital part to the success of the group. He commonly did the hooks and choruses of some of the
                    groups
                    most sucessful songs. Frank was the glue of the group and their quest for
                    freedom against society. </p>

                <img class="grid-img" src="earl_1.jpg" alt="Earl Sweatshirt">
                <p class="grid-text">Earl joined Odd Future when he was just sixteen years old. He was taken in by Tyler whom he viewed as an older brother type. Earl is known for his quick monotone flow that was a signature of the Odd Future
                    sound.
                    Earl had a dark side of him that bled into the Odd Future sound. Since his OF days, he has since released four albums with his most critically acclaimed being "I don't like shit, I don't go outside."</p>

                <p class="grid-text">The DJ and main engineer of the group, Syd tha Kid (now known as simply "Syd") was also the only female of the group. Still just like every other odd ball in the group, she fit in perfectly. After the Odd
                    Future
                    split, she stated her own group called <i>The Internet</i> with fellow OF member, Matt Martians. Her new group is quite sucessful in their own right with her as the lead vocalist. </p>

                <p class="grid-text">Jasper Dolphin is the outright goofball of the group and joined shortly after they had founded. He was not heavily involved in Odd Future's music as he only appeared in some of their tracks as a quick feature. Instead,
                    Jasper was more
                    vital to Odd Future's Adult Swim show <i>Loiter Squad</i> as he starred in the low-budget sketches along Tyler. the Creator and Lionel Boyce. He currently has his own shown on Viceland, <i>Jasper & Errol's First Time</i></p>

                <img class="grid-img" src="left.jpg" alt="Left Brain">
                <p class="grid-text">One of the main producers of Odd Future, Left Brain was crucial to the signature sound of OF. He has produced many songs for Odd Future, including for The Odd Future Tape & The OF Tape Vol. 2. He has also rapped on tracks
                    such as "Oldie", "Real B***h", "Swag Me Out", and also did the hook for " Trashwang". He is one half of MellowHype (with Hodgy Beats) and one third of MellowHigh (with Hodgy Beats and Domo Genesis) </p>

                <p class="grid-text">Domo Genesis joined Odd Future in mid-2009 because he was very good friends with Tyler, The Creator. His debut mixtape, Rolling Papers, was released on August 30, 2010. Production was done entirely by Tyler, The Creator,
                    Left Brain, and Syd tha Kyd. His first full LP, <i>Genesis</i> dropped in 2016 with impressive features from Mac Miller, Juicy J, Wiz Khalifa, and of course Tyler. The Creator. He is one third of MellowHigh (with Hodgy Beats and Left Brain)

                <p class="grid-text">The final main rapper of Odd Future, Mike G was a late addition to Odd Future. He made some noise after delivering a top-notch verse on Odd Furture's most popular track "Oldie" and later on dropped has dropped four
                    projects since the OF split, one as recently as last year. </p>

                <p class="grid-text">Similar to Jasper, Lionel was unessential to Odd Future's music. Instead, he was more of a hype man for the group. However, he was important member of OF as a fellow star of <i>Loiter Squad.</i> </p>
