            <h1 id="title">Potato Kugel, the Right Way</h1>
            <p id="p1" class="intro"> The potato kugel is an essential dish for all Jewish holidays but really everyone around the world should be eating this wonderful and super easy to make dish. Kugel can be made in many different ways - sweet, savory,
                or even
                a mix of both. It is essentially the wonderful kid of a Spanish tortilla and a giant latke. This recipe is quite simple: a lot of potatos, a lot of onions, and a whole lot of love. Enjoy at your own leisure! </p>

                    water first). Don't be afraid to do multiple rounds of squeezing to ensure as much water is removed.
