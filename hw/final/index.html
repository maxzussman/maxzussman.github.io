                    <i><b>Quick Thoughts:</b></i> Really loved The Backseat Lovers' sound. They truly encaptured a proper Indie Rock impression with this project. The overall tone of this album was pleasantly cohesive - it was definitely their own music but I
                    also really
                    enjoyed how each
                    song
                    felt a bit different. They definitely captured a lot of emotions throughout - especially about girls - which was not only enjoyable but relateable. They are still a pretty raw sound and have plenty of room to grow.<br><br>
                    <i><b>Would Recommend?</b></i> If you like any type of alternative music, yes.

                    <i><b>Quick Thoughts:</b></i> I actually went through a huge The Weeknd phase just prior to this project dropping, so I was super excited for one of the most anticiapted albums of the previous years to finally dropped. The Weeknd once
                    again
                    revolutionized his sound, making it feel like a pop album straight out of the 80s. It was an enjoyable album but some songs just didn't fully reesonate for
                    me.<br><br>
                    <i><b>Would Recommend?</b></i> If you are into pop R&B, this is about as good as it gets. However, you may be better off with checking out his older projects.

                    a

                    <i><b>Quick Thoughts:</b></i> Okay I have honstly never been a big Uzi fan but this project was too hyped up to not listen to. It is exactly what you think it would be. Uzi's iconic voice and flow over trap // club beats and some pretty
                    shitty
                    lyrics. The bangers did bang though but so many of these songs sound way too similar to one another - usually the downfall of any trap rap album. <br><br>

                    <i><b>Quick Thoughts:</b></i> After just listening and loving <i>How To Be A Human Being</i> I felt like I had to go listen to their first project. It was actually pretty interesting, still definitely the <i>Glass Aniamls</i> sound but
                    overall a much different feel from their latter album. This project is way more toned-down way more ~chill~. Definitely enjoyable but maybe a couple of filler songs.<br><br>

                    <i><b>Quick Thoughts:</b></i> This was a nice change of pace. I heard <i>Live Well</i> on a radio and loved the voice of the lead singer - very Hozier-esque. This album is super mellow, with a laid-back acoustic, folkly sound. Hard to not
                    appreciate this type of music. Beutiful

                    <i><b>Quick Thoughts:</b></i> Man, if you think you favorite rapper has a lot of content, Mac always just blows it out of the water. When Mac opens up and just rips it on the mic,
                    the swagger, the confidence, the spirit is just unmatched. The album started off super strong however, I think this album needed some serious editing. Too many filler tracks and
                    just a long, long album that makes you kind of lose interest towards the latter of the album. I would have enjoyed this project way more if Perfect Circle / God Speed was the finale track<br><br>

                    already knew his ageless hits prior to listening to the full album (like the two I mentioned) but the rest of the tracks on this album fill out beutifully as well. This may be the most cohesive project I have listened to yet.<br><br>

                    did not disappoint. Each track is composed beautifully with sounds wildly different from one an other but somehow connect quite perfectly. It is not necessarily
