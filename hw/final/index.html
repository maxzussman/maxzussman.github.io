            <h1 id="title"> <b>An Album a Day Keeps the Corona Virus Away</b></h1>
            <p id="intro-text"> Being stuck in quarantine sucks. You know what doesnâ€™t? Good music. Throughout the quarantine I have listened to a new album (almost) everyday to help me keep my head in a good space. It has been an awesome journey so far
                and I
                have discovered some incredible new bands and artists. Below are album recommendation/reviews for whatever quarantine mood you may be in! Want something upbeat and energetic to blast through your speakers and scare
                away

                    <i><b>Quick Thoughts:</b></i> I was super excited for one of the most anticiapted albums of the previous years to finally drop. The Weeknd once
                    again
                    revolutionized his sound, making it feel like a pop album straight out of the 80s. It was an enjoyable album but some songs just didn't fully resonate for
                    me. Too mainstream-trying-not-to-be-mainstream? Maybe.<br><br>
                    <i><b>Would Recommend?</b></i> If you are into pop R&B, this is about as good as it gets. However, you may be better off with checking out his older projects.

                    <i><b>Quick Thoughts:</b></i> Really loved The Backseat Lovers' sound. The overall tone of this album was pleasantly cohesive - it was definitely their own music but I

                    enjoyed how each
                    song
                    felt a bit different. They captured a lot of emotions throughout - especially about girls - which was not only enjoyable but relateable. They are still a pretty raw sound and have plenty of room to grow.<br><br>

                    band that sounds like <i>Glass Animals</i> and I say that in the best way possible. <i>Wavey Davey is on Fire.</i><br><br>

                    a
                    creative neo soul sound. Syd's vocals are truly the highlight of this project but man the cohesive sound of the group is something else. You can hear the chemistry between them. <br><br>

                    <i><b>Quick Thoughts:</b></i> This project is exactly what you think it would be - chaotic trap rap. It's Uzi's iconic voice and flow over trap // club beats and some pretty
                    shitty
                    lyrics. The bangers did bang but so many of these songs sound way too similar to one another - usually the downfall of any trap rap album. <br><br>
                    <i><b>Would Recommend?</b></i> If you're an Uzi fan yeah, otherwise can probably skip as a whole and just listen to the most popular songs

                    <i><b>Quick Thoughts:</b></i> After just listening and loving <i>How To Be A Human Being</i> I felt like I had to go listen to their first project. It was actually pretty interesting, still definitely the <i>Glass Aniamls</i> sound but
                    overall a much different feel from their latter album. This project is way more toned-down way more ~chill~. Definitely enjoyable but maybe a couple of filler songs.<br><br>

                    <i><b>Quick Thoughts:</b></i> This was a nice change of pace. I heard <i>Live Well</i> on a radio and loved the voice of the lead singer - very Hozier-esque. This album is super mellow, with a laid-back acoustic, folkly sound. Hard to not
                    appreciate this type of music. Beutiful
                    voice and an easy listen. You'll probably either hate it or love it depening on your type of music.<br><br>

                    <i><b>Quick Thoughts:</b></i> Man, if you think you favorite rapper has a lot of content, Mac always just blows it out of the water. When Mac opens up and just rips it on the mic,
                    the swagger, the confidence, the spirit is just unmatched. The album started off super strong however, I think this album needed some serious editing. Too many filler tracks and
                    just a long, long album that makes you kind of lose interest towards the latter of the album. I would have enjoyed this project way more if Perfect Circle / God Speed was the finale track.<br><br>

                    already knew his ageless hits prior to listening to the full album (like the two I mentioned) but the rest of the tracks on this album fill out beutifully as well. This may be the most cohesive project I have listened to yet.<br><br>

                    <i><b>Quick Thoughts:</b></i> Saba really opens up on this project, talking about his struggles growing up in the projects, losing his mentor and cousin to a stabbing on <i>PROM / KING </i>, and how being anti-social growing up affected his
                    chances with girls. It is definitely a mellow project and can be even hard to listen to at times - due to the context of his songs. The story telling, the word play, and the emotions on this project are truly ear opening.

                    Dawson's debut album. He blends experimental rap, with some pop and rock and delievers something I have really never heard of before. Jean Dawson will become the next big
                    thing soon, you heard it here first.

                    <i><b>Quick Thoughts:</b></i> Yeek actually put out one of my favorite albums of all time two years after this debut project so I was excited to hear his earlier days. This album is an easy listen and certainly very raw. It has a good
                    overall vibe but I can't say a single song really stands out. Some of the lyrics, covering his journey with love and girls, just seem kind of predictable and a tad boring. Still it is cool to see the origins of one of my favorite
                    artists.

                    <i><b>Quick Thoughts:</b></i> Goth Babe actually does not have an album out just a shit ton of singles. So, I made a little playlists of his tracks and listened to them as if they were an album. Goth Babe may be one of the most versatile
                    artists I have ever heard. While he certainly fits into that Indie//Alternative sound he has a whole rang of more electronicy, more rocky, or more mellow sounds.
