                    <i><b>Quick Thoughts:</b></i> Really loved The Backseat Lovers' sound. They truly encaptured a proper Indie Rock impression with this project. The overall tone of this album was pleasantly cohesive - it was definitely their own music but I
                    also really
                    enjoyed how each
                    song
                    felt a bit different. They captured a lot of emotions throughout - especially about girls - which was not only enjoyable but relateable. They are still a pretty raw sound and have plenty of room to grow.<br><br>

                    <i><b>Quick Thoughts:</b></i> I actually went through a huge The Weeknd phase just prior to this project dropping, so I was super excited for one of the most anticiapted albums of the previous years to finally dropped. The Weeknd once
                    again
                    revolutionized his sound, making it feel like a pop album straight out of the 80s. It was an enjoyable album but some songs just didn't fully reesonate for
                    me.<br><br>
                    <i><b>Would Recommend?</b></i> If you are into pop R&B, this is about as good as it gets. However, you may be better off with checking out his older projects.

                    shitty
                    lyrics. The bangers did bang though but so many of these songs sound way too similar to one another - usually the downfall of any trap rap album. <br><br>

                    appreciate this type of music. Beutiful

                    the swagger, the confidence, the spirit is just unmatched. The album started off super strong however, I think this album needed some serious editing. Too many filler tracks and
                    just a long, long album that makes you kind of lose interest towards the latter of the album. I would have enjoyed this project way more if Perfect Circle / God Speed was the finale track<br><br>

                    already knew his ageless hits prior to listening to the full album (like the two I mentioned) but the rest of the tracks on this album fill out beutifully as well. This may be the most cohesive project I have listened to yet.<br><br>

                    did not disappoint. Each track is composed beautifully with sounds wildly different from one an other but somehow connect quite perfectly. It is not necessarily

                    <i><b>Quick Thoughts:</b></i> Saba really opens up on this project, talking about his struggles growing up in the projects, losing his mentor and cousin to a stabbing on <i>PROM / KING </i>, and how being anti-social growing up affected his
                    chances with girls. It is definitely a mellow project and can be even hard to listen to at times - due to the context of his songs. The story telling, the word play, and the emotions on this project are truly ear opening.
                    <br><br>
                    <i><b>Would Recommend?</b></i> If you like Conscious Rap you will love this project, if not than pass

                    <i><b>Quick Thoughts:</b></i> Holy shit. You know when you stumble across a song by some random underground artist and instantely love an and cant believe that artist hasn't blown up yet? I had an extreme case of this when listening to
                    Dawson's debut album. This project is an amazing collage of sound, emotion, and energy. He blends experimental rap, with some pop and rock and delievers something I have really never heard of before. Jean Dawson will become the next big
                    thing soon, you heard it here first.
