            <h1>Odd Future <br> Wolf Gang <br>Kill Them All</h1>

            <p class="intro_text"> Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All, more commonly know as Odd Future or simply OF, <b>is one of the most influential rap groups</b> of the last decade. The group, founded in 2007, consisted of over ten
                members of different
                rappers, artists, and producers. They rose quickly to popularity with their unique sound of alternative hip-hop. <br><br>Agressive, out-their, and <b>seriously not giving a f**k</b>, are all words that come to mind when reminiscing on the
                group.

                Their
                concerts were known for extreme hype, mosh-pits, and a lot of adrenaline. <br><br>The group also had a huge influnece on street-wear and even released their own Odd Future line (known as Golf Wang) which still has a place in fashion today.
                The signatue OF Donut has become an iconic logo for the streetwear industry. <br><br> The group split up a
                few years
                ago so that members could pursue their own (very sucessful) solo careers but all hip-hop fans will forever know the importance of Odd Future in the music world. <br><br>The most vital members of the group are discussed below!</p>

                <p class="grid-text">The leader and one of the main founders of Odd Future, Tyler. the Creator, was a key part of the OF lifestyle and sound. He was also the star of the Odd Future comedy show <i>Loiter Squad</i> which aired on Comedy
                    Central for a few years. Since his Odd Future days, Tyler has released five studio albums, with his most previous one winning an Oscar. He is one of the most iconic hip-hop artist in the game today.</p>

                <img class="grid-img" src="frank.1.jpg" alt="Frank Ocean">
                <p class="grid-text">Mainly known as a mesmorizing singer (as opposed to a rapper like most of his Odd Future peers) Frank Ocean was a vital part to the success of the group. He commonly did the hooks and choruses of some of the
                    groups
                    most sucessful songs. Frank was the glue of the group and their quest for
                    freedom against society. </p>

                <h2 id="Earl" class="grid-hed">Earl Sweat<br>shirt</h2>
                <img class="grid-img" src="earl_1.jpg" alt="Earl Sweatshirt">
                <p class="grid-text">Earl joined Odd Future when he was just sixteen years old. He was taken in by Tyler whom he viewed as an older brother type. Earl is known for his quick monotone flow that was a signature of the Odd Future
                    sound.
                    Earl had a dark side of him that bled into the Odd Future sound. Since his OF days, he has since released four albums with his most critically acclaimed being "I don't like shit, I don't go outside."</p>

                <p class="grid-text">The DJ and main engineer of the group, Syd tha Kid (now known as simply "Syd") was also the only female of the group. Still just like every other odd ball in the group, she fit in perfectly. After the Odd
                    Future
                    split, she stated her own group called <i>The Internet</i> with fellow OF member, Matt Martians. Her new group is quite sucessful in their own right with her as the lead vocalist. </p>
